 * NewsPool Service.
 * 
 * The news pool produces/retrieves some text, which belong to specific 
 * categories (it is useless to model further its treatment), and send it to a
 * publish/subscribe component. The latter is accessed by a set of editors that
 * treat the news dispatch for which they are interested in, and thus, they have
 * subscribe to. The pool also sends the news dispatch <em>id</em> to the
 * editor-in-chief, in a <em>secure</em> and <em>acknowledged</em> way.
